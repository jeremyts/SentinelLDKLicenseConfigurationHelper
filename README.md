Download the latest compiled Release as a zip posted to the right hand side of this repository under Releases.

This is a brand new service I've created. I will be writing an article with full installation instructions.

This is compiled licensed software. The compiled code has been obfuscated to prevent decompiling and duplication of this project. The service will run for 10 minutes without a valid license and then stop itself, clearing the configuration. This may provide enough time to test it out. I am happy to provide a 30 day evaluation license on request.
